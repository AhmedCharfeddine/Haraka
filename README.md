# Haraka ðŸ” ðŸª„

A fast and simple Arabic transliteration tool built with Go.

## Overview

Haraka is a (currently WIP) lightweight tool that helps convert Latin script into Arabic script. 

Based on Latin input, it provides real-time transliteration suggestions for Arabic words. Haraka enables you to type in Arabic with speed âš¡ 

## Who's this for?

If your main keyboard is in Latin and you:  

ðŸ”¹ Type faster with Latin layouts  
ðŸ”¹ Use a keyboard with missing Arabic labels  
ðŸ”¹ Are too lazy to swap keyboard language

Then Haraka is for you âœ¨

## Build

The project assumes you have GO installed on your system. The build steps are:

1. Building the project binaries:
```
$ go build
```
2. Running the system-wide installation:
```
$ go intall
```
3. Testing the CLI tool:
```
$ haraka --help
$ haraka map salaam
Ø³Ù„Ø§Ù…
```
