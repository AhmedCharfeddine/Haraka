# Haraka ğŸ” ğŸª„

A fast and simple Arabic transliteration tool built with Go.

## Overview

Haraka is a (currently WIP) lightweight tool that helps convert Latin script into Arabic script. 

Based on Latin input, it provides real-time transliteration suggestions for Arabic words. Haraka enables you to type in Arabic with speed âš¡ 

## Who's this for?

If your main keyboard is in Latin and you:  

ğŸ”¹ Type faster with Latin layouts  
ğŸ”¹ Use a keyboard with missing Arabic labels  
ğŸ”¹ Are too lazy to swap keyboard language

Then Haraka is for you âœ¨

## Roadmap

ğŸ”¹ Improve word suggestions using a Trie  
ğŸ”¹ Add support for common Arabic phrases  
ğŸ”¹ Implement a GUI version  
ğŸ”¹ System-wide integration for real-time typing
